This is a quite simple application for spamming random generated data for given json. It's supposed to be used as a load testing app for open endpoints

This is NOT a DDoS tool or something and exists for API/endpoints performance diagnostics purposes only. Developers are not resposible how if it is used in inappropriate way.
